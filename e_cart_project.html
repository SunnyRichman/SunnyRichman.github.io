    <button class="collapsible"><h3>Objectives</h3></button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a simplified e-commerce cart system where users can view products, add them to their cart, romove items, reorder items, and proceed to a simulated checkout</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <button class="collapsible"><h3>Challenges faced and how they were addressed</h3></button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing ArrayList and LinkedList since I never go thorough out those classes</li>
        <li>Those problems can be solved by following the contents that provided in the course materials.</li>
        <li>Another challenges are about to implement the products’ storage, customer cart, or checkout system, but they’re not quite difficult as I or my friends have the knowledge from the pre-requisite course. I just have to go back to review it for a little.</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <button class="collapsible"><h3>Additional Features Implemented and Their Rationale</h3></button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Page Switching: The customer who are shopping in my own application can switch the page to view my products that have a numbers of product which will be displayed per page.</li>
        <li>Maximum Product Display: For the customers who think that the initial number of the products which will be displayed per page is less than or greater than their demand, they can use this feature to make the userr life easier and enjoy shopping in my application.</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <button class="collapsible"><h3>Lesson Learned and Possible Future Improvement</h3></button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>LinkedList implementation since I am accustomed to use the Array List, I am certainly sure that I know how it had been constructed</li>
        <li>For the LinkedList one, I can say that I know nothing about it at first sight even if it was implemented from List interface, like ArrayList. However, both ArrayList and LinkedList that I implemented in the project aren’t the best one. They still lack efficiency and convenient.</li>
      </ul>
